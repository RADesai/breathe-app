        Guided Diaphragmatic Breathing
        <br />
        <br />
        From ancient times the breath has been recognised as the key to our
        life.
        <br />
        <br />
        Proper breathwork helps balance & clarify one&apos;s emotions that
        supports the individuals to unfold their highest potential.
        <br />
        <br />
        Like all movement in the body the mechanics of the breathing are related
        to muscular contraction; and inhalation is specifically initiated as a
        result of the intercostal muscles (the muscles between the ribs) and the
        diaphragm. The process is as follows : The intercostals contract; the
        rib cage elevates; the diaphragm contracts downward, the elevation of
        rib cage combined with the downward movement of the diaphragm creates
        negative density in the thoracic cavity,allowing air to be sucked into
        the lungs and the result is an expansion of the thoracic cavity. Other
        muscles involved in the process include the erector spinae, the
        semispinalis, the multifidus, the serratus posterior group and the inter
        spinalis-all of which contribute to the elevation of rib cage ,
        expansion of the chest, flattening of the thoracic curve, and vertical
        extension of the spine.
        <br />
        <br />
        Conscious use of Inhale in Asana practice should enhance this natural
        process and all of the following movements when linked with Inhale are
        designed for this purpose: raising arms, expanding the chest, arching
        the back, moving into backbends, extension postures and straightening of
        the spine from a forward bena, a twist or lateral position.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the Viniyoga tradition generally Inhale begins with the
        expansion of the upper chest. As inhalation progresses, move the
        expansion down into the middle and finally into the lower portion of the
        rib cage.
        <br />
        <br />
        The normal unconscious exhalation is the result of the relaxation of the
        muscles responsible for Inhalation.
        <br />
        <br />
        The process is as follows: As the intercostal muscles relax the rib cage
        returns from its elevated position, as the diaphragm relaxes it raises
        up and the result is the expulsion of air from the lungs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Conscious use of exhalation does not follow natural processes. Rather
        than simply relaxing the muscles contracted for inhalation we
        intentionally contract the abdominal muscles progressively from the
        pubic bone to navel. This contraction is initiated at the rectus
        abdominis, and then engages both the obliques and transverse
        abdominals.In certain circumstances we may also intentionally contract
        the superficial and deep musculature of the perineal floor, including
        the anal sphincter, the urethral sphincter, the levator ani muscles and
        the deep transverse perineus.
        <br />
        <br />
        This action stabilizes the pelvic lumbar relationship, creates more
        structural stability, helps in flattening lumbar lordosis and when there
        is contraction of all the muscles mentioned above, it also supports the
        organs of the pelvis and lower abdomen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Inhale - Retain (Hold Breath after Inhale)
        <br />
        Exhale - Suspend (Hold Breath after exhale)
        <br />
        <br />
        Our Breath is divided into four parts. During our normal breathing we
        take a small pause when transitioning from inhale to exhale or exhale to
        inhale. The below breathwork is intentional and means to bring our
        awareness to our body and mind through breath.
        <br />
        <br />
        Retention helps strengthen our breath, stabilize our senses, increase
        our inner awareness, calm the mind and energize the body.
        <br />
        <br />
        The breathwork video below gives you an option to select the length of
        breath that works for you in the moment and try 6-12-16 breaths of your
        choice.
        <br />
        <br />
        In = Inhale ( through the nose)
        <br />
        R = Hold after Inhale
        <br />
        Ex = Exhale (through the nose mouth closed)
        <br />
        S = Hold after Exhale
        <br />
        <br />
        In = 4 ( Inhale cannot be longer than exhale)
        <br />
        Retain (Kumbhaka) = 4 (retention cannot be longer than inhale)
        <br />
        Exhale = 4 ( exhale needs to be equal to or greater than inhale)
        <br />
        Suspend (Rechaka)= 4 ( Suspension cannot be longer than the exhale)
        <br />
        <br />
        The above Ration is a SAMAMA practice of breathwork. Helps cultivate
        inner peace, balance and groundedness.
